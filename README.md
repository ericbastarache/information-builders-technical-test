# Filterable/Sortable Table

### Features

- Filter on any column in the table
- Sort on any column in the table
- Default field sorted is date
- Built using Material UI


Note: There is a sortable table already in Material UI but I did not use it because I wanted to demonstrate ability to sort/filter without using pre build functionality.

## Getting up and running

1. Ensure you have yarn or npm installed (yarn is preferred)
2. Open the repository and run `yarn` to install the dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` and `yarn server` in two different terminal windows
